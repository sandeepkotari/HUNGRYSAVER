# HUNGRYSAVER
Many events waste food while many poor people go hungry. Patients needing urgent medical help often lack funds, though donors are willing to support them. Hungry Saver connects event organizers, volunteers, and donors to collect leftover food and distribute it to the needy. It also enables secure donations for urgent medical cases.
